And there is this quest for happiness. I found this wonderful podcast from [Happiness Lab](https://lnkd.in/guavPyc) by Dr. Laurie Santos.


There is also an app called [Donate a Photo](https://lnkd.in/gtTr9Hh) by Johnson & Johnson which lets you donate a dollar a day for a cause for a picture upload:


Move from [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/) to [smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/) and donate a little to a charity of your choice.

I have started doing:  
i. 30 Minute Walks  
ii. 1 Gallon Water a day  
iii. Cold Showers 3 days a week  
iv. 30 minutes of no electronic media
